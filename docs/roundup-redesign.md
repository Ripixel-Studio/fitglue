**Implemented as a full rewrite of `web/src/showcase/pages/ShowcaseRoundupPage.tsx`** using the
`rp-*` class system (CSS in `web/src/showcase/showcase.css`). All chart components are pure SVG
(no chart library). Pure data-transform helpers live in `web/src/showcase/utils/roundup.ts`
(unit-tested in `__tests__/roundup.test.ts`). The share modal keeps the
landscape/square/story shapes (`ShowcaseRoundupExportModal`) — **not** the design's 1080×1080
squares — and the sticky bar retains the future "Create Reel" video affordance.

## Sections

### 1. Hero / Crown
Full-viewport opening. Already exists — Design will reimagine layout, not data.

### 2. AI Summary ("In Words") ✅ SHIPPED
- Proto field: `ai_summary = 29` on `ShowcaseRoundup`
- Written by Claude via the box CLI (`pkg/claude`) in `internal/activity/roundup_ai.go`
- Called from `generateRoundup()` before `SetRoundup` — non-blocking (empty string on failure)
- Frontend: pull-quote card with gradient left border, renders when `aiSummary` is non-empty
- Prompt: first person in James's voice (`pkg/voice` guide + guard), no names, no "you", no emoji, only the period's numbers
- `ai_summary_model` (47) / `ai_summary_generated_at` (48) record who wrote it: `claude-sonnet` for this path, empty for the old Gemini third-person ones. `fitgluectl regen-roundup-stories` rewrites the stale ones (only the story; the numbers stay)
- 120-second Claude timeout (`roundupAISummaryTimeout`); on failure the roundup saves with no story

### 3. Comparison Band
Previous-period delta ticker: ↑+12% sessions / ↓−8% distance / ↑+3 PRs.

**Backend needed:**
- `GetRoundup(ctx, slug, previousPeriodKey)` already exists in the store
- The previous period key can be computed client-side from the current `periodKey` using `parsePeriodKey` logic
- No new proto fields needed — fetch previous roundup via the existing public endpoint and compute deltas in the frontend

**Frontend needed:**
- Fetch `previousRoundup` alongside current on page load
- Compute deltas and render the ticker ribbon

### 4. Callout Activities
2–3 spotlight cards: biggest session, most PRs in one session.

**Backend needed:**
- `ShowcaseRoundup` currently has aggregate stats but no per-activity pointers
- Option A: Add `callout_activities []ShowcaseCalloutActivity` to proto (pre-selected by generator)
- Option B: Store top-N activity IDs in roundup and fetch from showcase entries
- Recommendation: Option A — add 3 callout slots computed in `generateRoundup`

### 5. Sport Breakdown — Charts
Data exists (`activityTypeBreakdowns`). Need a charting library.
- Donut chart for count by sport
- Stacked bar for distance by sport
- Candidate: `recharts` (already in web deps?) or lightweight SVG-only solution

### 6. Consistency Calendar
GitHub-style heatmap. One cell per day of the period, colour = effort level.

**Backend needed:** New endpoint or proto field — `day_entries []RoundupDayEntry{ date, effort_level }` on `ShowcaseRoundup`, populated during generation from `ListShowcaseEntriesInRange` results.

### 7. Effort Deep Dive
Exists as a basic band. Design will replace with HR zone donut/ring.

### 8. Highlights Band ✅ SHIPPED
Fields 24–28 on `ShowcaseRoundup`: longest session, highest cal/hr, peak avg BPM.

### 9. Personal Records Wall
Exists. Design will replace basic medal list with dense grid.

### 10. Sticky Share Bar
Frontend-only. Appears after scrolling past hero. Three actions: Share Card, Copy Link, Create Reel (future/dimmed).

## Proto Changes Needed (upcoming)

```protobuf
// Callout activities (Section 4)
message ShowcaseCalloutActivity {
  string title = 1;
  string activity_id = 2;
  double duration_seconds = 3;
  double distance_meters = 4;
  int32 pr_count = 5;
  string callout_reason = 6; // "longest", "most_prs", etc.
}

// Consistency calendar (Section 6)
message RoundupDayEntry {
  string date = 1; // YYYY-MM-DD
  int32 effort_level = 2; // 0=none 1=easy 2=moderate 3=hard
  int32 activity_count = 3;
}

// On ShowcaseRoundup:
repeated ShowcaseCalloutActivity callout_activities = 30;
repeated RoundupDayEntry day_entries = 31;
```

## Sharing System

Export modal already ships with:
- 3 tabs: Overview card, PR Wall card, Story (9:16)
- Shape selector: landscape / square / story
- Transparent background mode
- Per-element toggles (athlete name, date range, sources, watermark, stats selection)

**Planned additions (post-design):**
- Per-section share buttons (hover ghost icon on each section → opens export modal pre-scrolled to that section's card)
- Roundup Reel (client-side MediaRecorder + Canvas animation — no server cost)
- 3D card tilt on Overview card (CSS `perspective` + `rotateX/Y` on mousemove)

## Phasing

**Phase 1:** AI Summary, Highlights, proto field foundations — ✅ done
**Phase 2:** Redesign Hero, Comparison Band, Sticky Share Bar — ✅ done
**Phase 3:** Charts (donut, stacked bar), Consistency Calendar — ✅ done (pure SVG)
**Phase 4:** Callout Activities, per-section share buttons — ✅ done
**Phase 5:** Roundup Reel video export, 3D card tilt — ✅ done
- 3D tilt on the share-card preview (perspective + rotateX/Y, respects
  prefers-reduced-motion).
- Roundup Reel: a 12s 9:16 clip built client-side (canvas 2D + MediaRecorder →
  WebM, no server cost) — `web/src/showcase/utils/roundupReel.ts` +
  `RoundupReelPanel.tsx`, surfaced as a "Reel ▶" tab and the sticky-bar Create
  Reel button. Needs real-browser verification (MediaRecorder/captureStream).

## Rich-data phases (6–8)

Using the data already flowing through showcase entries + enrichments.

**Phase 6 — Rich media — ✅ done**
- `photos` (field 32) + `routes` (field 33) on `ShowcaseRoundup`, collected in
  `generateRoundup` from each entry's `photo_urls` / `route_thumbnail_url`
  (photos gated by `show_photo_gallery`; capped 24/12).
- Frontend: Photo Mosaic (first photo featured 2×2) + Route Wall sections.

**Phase 7 — Enrichment sections — ✅ done**
- Enrichment summaries projected onto `ShowcaseProfileEntry` (fields 21–27:
  `elevation_gain_m`, `location_name`, `country`, `temp_c`,
  `weather_description`, `best_efforts`, `primary_muscles`) at entry-creation
  time in `AddShowcaseEntry`, from the GCS-hydrated `ActivityEnrichments`.
- `generateRoundup` aggregates these into: `total_elevation_gain_meters`
  (now populated), `places` (34), `weather` (35), `best_efforts` (36),
  `muscles` (37).
- Frontend sections: Muscles under load, Places trained, Weather grit, Fastest
  known times, and a Total Vertical highlight with a landmark comparison.
- **Caveat:** enrichment data accrues forward — it only appears on activities
  synced after this shipped (no backfill of historical entries).

**Phase 8 — Shareables v2 — ✅ done**
- Chart components extracted to `web/src/showcase/components/RoundupCharts.tsx`,
  made size/colour configurable (center labels moved into the SVG viewBox) so
  the same charts serve the page and the exporter.
- New 1080px export cards in `RoundupExportCards.tsx`: Sport (donut), HR (rings),
  Calendar (heatmap), Vs (comparison), Photo and Route — each honouring the
  shared background/shape/accent/text config, shown as tabs only when the data
  exists. The existing Overview / PR Wall / Story (9:16 Instagram) cards remain.
- Per-section Share buttons open the modal pre-targeted to the matching card
  (`initialCard`); the page passes the previous roundup through for the Vs card.
- Shapes (landscape/square/story) + Create Reel [Soon] retained.
- **Known limit:** `html-to-image` only embeds cross-origin photos/routes when
  the asset host allows CORS; the preview always renders, the PNG may omit the
  image otherwise (surfaced as a modal hint). Verify against real asset URLs.
